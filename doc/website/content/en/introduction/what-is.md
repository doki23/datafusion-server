DataFusion Server is an HTTP-based server that supports multiple sessions, various data sources, and fast queries. Python data source connectors and processor plugins are also supported.

DataFusion Server uses [Apache DataFusion](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/) as its main feature and the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) ecosystem as the foundation for asynchronous processing and multiple sessions.
